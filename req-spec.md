## Objectives

Building a website for the People's Fund for Global Health and Development


# Target groups

## People who are interested in contributing money to help out

## Young professionals and students
> 18-35 year old's primarily, i.e. Young professionals and students. I envision it as having a bit of a people's movement appeal, a dash of grassroots, so a modern look, large images, not very dissimilar to what amnesty is doing (without the barbed wire and neon yellow though :)). But highly professional and clean, we're investing people's money on their behalf so we want to signal that we're capable of doing that in a responsible way. "The global fund to fight TB aids and malaria", and amnesty international are my two gold standards in terms of website design. 

* Priority: High
* Usage: Contributing
* Considerations: Modern look

## Retired people
> Secondarily: 65+: retired people that have time, perhaps money, and want to do good, but the above group will be our primary target group.

* Priority: Low
* Usage: Contributing
* Considerations: Simplicity

## People in low-income counties

* Priority: Medium
* Usage: Applying for funding
* Considerations: Mobile platforms, low bandwidth
