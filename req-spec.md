# Intro

## Target groups for this document

Both tech and non-tech people. **This document can be seen as the "interface" between these two groups**, it is therefore important that both groups understand it and that the language used is not too technical

## Context

The People's Fund has various ways to communicate outward:
* Presence on the web:
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * Other social media
  * **The website** - this is where this document comes in
* Other ways to communicate

## Scope

## References

## Objectives

Building a website for the People's Fund for Global Health and Development


# Target groups

## People who are interested in contributing money to help out

## Young professionals and students
> 18-35 year old's primarily, i.e. Young professionals and students. I envision it as having a bit of a people's movement appeal, a dash of grassroots, so a modern look, large images, not very dissimilar to what amnesty is doing (without the barbed wire and neon yellow though :)). But highly professional and clean, we're investing people's money on their behalf so we want to signal that we're capable of doing that in a responsible way. "The global fund to fight TB aids and malaria", and amnesty international are my two gold standards in terms of website design. 

* Priority: High
* Usage: Contributing
* Considerations: Modern look

## Retired people
> Secondarily: 65+: retired people that have time, perhaps money, and want to do good, but the above group will be our primary target group.

* Priority: Low
* Usage: Contributing
* Considerations: Simplicity

## People in low-income counties

* Priority: Medium
* Usage: Applying for funding
* Considerations: Mobile platforms, low bandwidth, other languages


# Functional requirements

## Static information pages

* Who we are
* What we do
* Where we work
* ~~Apply for funding~~ - see below
* ~~Support us~~ - see below

## *Funding application ("Apply for funding")*

Q: Do we want to put this on a separate website? (Ex: apply.thepeoples.fund)

## *Funding evalution*

> The rating portal: How to translate an equation of weighted variables (i.e. impact rating *08 + sustainability rating *0.7 + cost-effectiveness rating * 0.6 ... = Total rating) into code. This would be in a portal environment where you first read about the project and click rating values from 1-5 on a number of different parameters.

## Donations ("Support us")

### Storing donation records
.. in our own database

## User registration

## Blog posts (news items)

### Website and social media synchronized

> We will write news updates every once in a while, so Website, facebook and twitter in synchrony is exactly where we want to be.

"Responsive" website theme

We would like to use the mobile version of the website as a low-bandwidth version

> I think a common feature that I love about these websites, is the large, beautiful, colorful images everywhere, the large simple icons to click on, and the fact that you just scroll down and get little bits of important information, no wall of text, and a lot becomes available just by scrolling down, you don't have to do many clicks and navigate much to reach core information on the organisation, as exemplified here for instance: https://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/
