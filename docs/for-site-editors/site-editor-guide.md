### Editing or creating static pages

The static pages on the website (available from the menu) mostly uses a html template

#### Reverting to a previous version

All static pages are version controlled, this means that it's possible to go back to earlier versions if we like

Once you are on the edit page, you can find the revisions by clicking on the tab with the same name:
![](_img/Selection_009.png)
