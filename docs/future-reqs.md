## *Funding application ("Apply for funding")*
Aka: "Project application submission portal"

Will most probably be put on the website (rather than in a separate portal) so everything easily integrated into one plugin/module


## *Funding evaluation system*

> Step 1: Alignment with local country priorities using data from http://data.myworld2015.org - only projects that align with the top 5 priorities within the country can be funded. Data will have to be corrected for gender and education level. 

> Step 2: A local survey (logistically very complicated - suggestions very welcome!!). Mobile phone based surveymonkey-survey? Paper?

> Step 3: The member rating portal: How to translate an equation of weighted variables (i.e. impact rating *08 + sustainability rating *0.7 + cost-effectiveness rating * 0.6 ... = Total rating) into code. This would be in a portal environment where you first read about the project and click rating values from 1-5 on a number of different parameters, with some help on the way, including any tricks that make it fun to rate, and some control mechanisms to ensure that the user has actually read the application, and then a final thank you/pad on your shoulder when you're done rating a project.



## Discussion forum
  * General member discussion forum
   * All members and volunteers have read and write access to this forum. Will be the largest forum, available to everyone with a login
  * Country-level volunteers forums
   * One for each country we have country ambassadors in, and then all the volunteers in that country can login to his/her individual country forum
    * All board members, all country ambassadors and all admin accounts have read and write access to all country-level forums
    * Within-country volunteers have read and write access to the forum within their country
 

## Blog posts (news items)

### Website and social media synchronized
* Priority: high

> We will write news updates every once in a while. Posts to Website, facebook and twitter in synchrony is exactly what we want.


## *Languages other than English*
will be a likely step at a later stage.


## Secure payments and user data privacy

https may be needed from the web host


## Good data storage

TBD: Investigate what this means
