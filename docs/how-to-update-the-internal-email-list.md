# How to update the internal email list

1. Log in to the CiviHosting control panel
2. One of these alternatives:
  * Go to https://cp.s801.sureserver.com/maillist/subscribers.php?list=internal
  * 2b. Alternaitvely: Under "Tools" click on "Mailing list", then click on "subscribers"
3. (If you want to add another person to the email list:) Enter the email of the new subscriber
4. Click on "add"

You don't need to (and it's best not to)  add the new email to the "allowed" list. This is because of how we have configured this email list
