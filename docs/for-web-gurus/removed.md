#### Installation

At the time of writing we are using the dev version and not the official version. (The dev version can be downloaded from the github repo (using the green button in the upper right corner)). Whichever version we choose, we need to manually install the extension by copying the files onto the server ourselves and activate the plugin afterwards

1. uploading to directory
/home/sunyata/public_html/civicrm-drupal/sites/default/files/civicrm/ext/

(The CiviCRM wiki documentation has an instruction which may or may not be up to date: https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Extensions)

2. refresh

3. click on the install button on this page
