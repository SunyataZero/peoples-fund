> FF: I think a common feature that I love about these websites, is the large, beautiful, colorful images everywhere, the large simple icons to click on, and the fact that you just scroll down and get little bits of important information, no wall of text, and a lot becomes available just by scrolling down, you don't have to do many clicks and navigate much to reach core information on the organisation, as exemplified here for instance: https://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/
