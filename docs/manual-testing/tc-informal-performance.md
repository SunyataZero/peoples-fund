> Hi all, i'd like to ask anyone in Africa, Asia, or South America what your experience has been using our new website
https://peoplesfundglobal.org
> 
> Is it faster or slower than other websites that you visit when going between the pages in the menu? (I'm not looking for timings, just your subjective experiences)
> 
> Big sites like google.com and twitter.com will probably be faster because they have multiple servers spread out over the world that can send the pages to visitors over a shorter distance, but what about these sites:
> http://www.uniteforsight.org (server located in the US)
> http://www.theglobalfund.org (server located in Switzerland)
> Can you see a difference in loading time when comparing with our website? (Our server is located in Holland)
> 
> Grateful for help!
> 
> Kind Regards,
> Tord
