## Security risks
Details not discussed here, instead if you have access you can load [this document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HMuYRhF7ktQZBxwdGCj4kNgfTbD29X9EBWp0pVIIyw)


## Data loss

CiviHosting makes automated backups. If dataloss happens it's important that we contact them as soon as possible since there is a backup rotation (old backups are removed after a while)


## Personell loss

### If Tord leaves
Because of lack of time

### Measures we can take
* Improve documentation so other people can take over
* Finding other people willing to help out


## Incompatible tech

After runnning an update various tech may become incompatible

This is probably not a big problem since we are running pretty wide-spread tech in general
