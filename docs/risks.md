## Security risks
Details not discussed here, instead if you have access you can load [this document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HMuYRhF7ktQZBxwdGCj4kNgfTbD29X9EBWp0pVIIyw)


## Data loss

### System change
For example if we change from PMP to another way of storing data


## Personell loss

### If Tord leaves
Because of lack of time

### Measures we can take
* Improve documentation so other people can take over
* Finding other people willing to help out


## Efficiency and maintenance

  PMP is not good at handling many different groups of donations, so if the number of donation levels increase in the future we may need to switch. (But there may be a nice JavaScript solution or other workaround)
